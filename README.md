# RobotAssistant

A Robot which will perform the different morning tasks which most of us perform before going to class in college for us to simplify our lives. Every day in the morning we need to complete some set of predefined tasks that remain constant. We can list the generic tasks as below:

Ring the alarm on time
Make coffee
Heat the water to a suitable temperature
Pack your bag (Keep only appropriate books for the day)
Cook breakfast and lunch
Iron the clothes
From now on a Kotlin Robot will complete the above set of tasks for us.
